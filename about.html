      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        I programming language is a high level programming language written in rust.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          We always had a dream of programming in a language, designed like we
          wanted to. <a href="https://github.com/ElBe-Plaq">ElBe</a> first created
          "ElBlang", stored in a private repository and not being capable of doing
          anything. After a disscussion with a different developer,
          <a href="https://github.com/MasterOktagon">MasterOktagon</a>, they wanted
          to create their own language. ElBe created the project outline, while
          MasterOkatagon was busy making the lexer.
          <a href="https://github.com/Ranastra">Ranastra</a> joined shortly after.
          They together created a parser, but quickly realized that doing this in python
          was not a good idea. So they archived the repository and made a new one,
          this time in Rust.

        <h2>Syntax</h2>
        <p>
          The syntax is mostly inspired by Rust, but also has some features from
          Python and C++. Currently there are 21 keywords, 48 marks (operators and
          other symbols) and some other syntax features.
