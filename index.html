        <h2>What is I Language?</h2>
        <p>
          The I programming language is a high level programming language written in rust.
          I Language has been inspired by Rust, C++ and Python. It's goal is to combine the best
          of the three to make a fun and easy to use language which is still capable of complex
          use cases, such as developing a game, GUI application or api. It's also aimed to have
          a big and up-to-date standard library and a good package manager ecosystem.

        <h2>Feature flags</h2>
        <p>
          Feature flags are a special bit of code you use to enable certain
          features within the compiler. Using feature flags on the CLI you can
          also change compiler internals that don't "know" about the code.

        />
        <h2>Stability and release schedule</h2>
        <p>
          I Language's aim is to provide a new release every quartal. There will
          be LTS (long term support) versions, which will be aimed for people
          who rely on especially stable versions without experimental or non
          finished code. There'll also be experimental versions every month which
          should be stable enough for most people.
